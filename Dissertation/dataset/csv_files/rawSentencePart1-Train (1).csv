sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp i walked out of a couple movies and i,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp mark wahlberg was terrible he will never get a job after this,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp mark,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp campy and like a two hour long twilight,20
sp sp sp hopefully because he was so bad in this movie and m night wanted this to be campy,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp are rooting for m night i,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp to the twilight zone this is a terrible movie umm i know people,20
were actually really good in twilight zone this is this is stutter that was a insult to the twilight zone,20
hour long twilight zone and with even worse actors than they had back in the day umm they were actually,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp much more it really could have been but mark,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and it sp even that gory it could have been so much more,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp know he sp made a movie since lady in the water,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp m night i know you,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp forbid that movie too sp just on stutter he hit,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp in the water god's forbid that,20
sp sp years old like this kid's he he stutter know what sp doing any more the sixth sense,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp he hit his peak at twenty three,20
sp sp sp sp sp makes the part of their brain some chemical part in their brain shut off umm,20
and then there came the village which was not great but it was still okay there was the twist there,20
good but even then go see it even see it as a satire not worth it,16
sp sp sp sp make a movie where he could just have people kill themselves in the most creative ways,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp night has got to,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp a terrible film terrible m night has,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp night really wanted to do was,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp creative ways possible because all this was and it sp,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp umm so they all kill themselves so i think what m night really,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp silly and,20
sp but even if the application sp written well having this web application firewall gives you another line of defense,20
to check all the different ways to validate data inside of your application but your web application firewall certainly can,20
up with a series of standards that people have to follow if you store credit card information on your servers,20
level to be able to validate input into those web fields becomes critically important especially when sensitive data is involved,20
the sequel database then they would also have access to potentially credit card numbers that might be in that database,20
see this used to make sure that when people are information into a web form that that information is correct,20
trying to determine based on that web conversation if the information within your packets within that conversation is legitimate,19
those are very bad things because often that does allow somebody's some very detailed access to some very sensitive data,20
can get a four pack of these for the same price you can get cheap razors for because you,19
sp sp sp sp sp the one thing you definitely want to do is leave this in your shower,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp give it a try,20
sp sp so definitely keep this dry in between uses and get a much longer life out of them,19
sp because especially in the summertime most of us are shaving more often than we might in the cold weather,20
sp sp sp sp but if looking for a great new razor to try i highly recommend gillette venus,19
sp sp sp sp and they come in a handy little package like this to keep everything from drying out,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp now what makes these so great is this stuff right here and right here,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp give it a try,20

sp sp because then that automatically makes me think i might not think again we jump back to spontaneity,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp never really been his strong suit but he usually casts,20
sp sp sp sp sp actors or at least gets the best out of the actors that he casts to,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp casts to make up for it uhh with,20
sp sp sp sp gibson paul giamatti uhh bryce dallas howard sp all decent actors in his movies i,19
the problem is also that the dialogue and the acting are atrocious uhh probably the best word i can,19
sub par movies compared to the three movies that he made originally but they were at least well made films,20
sp sp sp sp films uhh this sp surprised this movie actually got any kind of release any kind of,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp distribution the dialogue is horrible never,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp signs and the not so good movies the village and lady in the umm,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp previously directed the good movies sixth sense and,20
sp sp a little bit umm the movie stars mark wahlberg as a science teacher and as his and also,20
unfortunately this one even fit into the not so good movies category sp get to that in a little,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp something happens at the beginning of the movie,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp john as his friend,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp killing,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and for some reason people start talking funny,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp about and,20
sp sp sp sp the cause of this is never fully explained umm there are theories that are thrown about,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp problem with this movie sp so much the plot,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp big theory is pretty silly,20
but unfortunately most of the time the actors actually find themselves walking or running rather away from the wind they,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp plot umm it was probably a good idea,20
if that sounds exciting to you then maybe you can go check this movie out but otherwise bother umm,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp wind they run away from the,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp or who are usually pretty fine,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp john or who are,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp it feels like the words are being read off of a script as,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp what exactly happened here but the acting it,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp so i know what exactly,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp themselves so i,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp fine actors themselves,20
watch what exactly will the new bailout for the banks look like what exactly is this new lending fund mean,20
potentially that the government is now going to create its own lending facility to compete directly with the commercial banks,20
sp sp sp sp another thing that addressed in his discussion and has talked about before is the mortgage bailout,20
to be very interesting to watch how the details unfold on what exactly he means by this new lending fund,20
people who have bought homes that they could not afford they also are not going to benefit from the bailout,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp does this mean that we are going to potentially change our bankruptcy laws,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp not realize solely on tv,20
currently doing very easy line and you get a yes or maybe you can take it from there i did,20

sp sp sp now the final thing you wanna do is gather as many business cards as possible i want,20
this is probably the most important thing you should do and then follow up with these people afterwards give them,20
to follow up and just to see if you are actually open to what doing business wise you know would,20
so my place to order business cards is vista print a very reliable company they failed me yet had tons,20
tips that will help you to get more contacts for your business and expose your business to more people so,20
a link in my video description if you actually got a link already of where to buy business cards now,20
sp sp sp sp sp me yet had tons of orders through them they have served me for years i,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp cards out go to networking functions,20
next thing we do is that we network locally in order to hand these business cards out go to networking,20
you have to travel a bit but definitely worth networking gong to these events at least once a month now,20
sp sp sp sp sp look locally and see if there is anything for local business owners there must be,20
sp sp sp they will find any living breathing soul and just tell them all about their business this is,20
in and other companies they will go into these networking events and they will just throw up information they will,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp get maybe you can say something like this get paid to help people lose,20
wanna make it interesting so instead of you saying am a distributor in what you wanna say is get maybe,20
that work then and you would say one we help customer lose x amount of weight in x amount of,20
and then people can ask you more and you just tell them but in snippets of information and they will,20
are really interested then you can have them take a look at your website or video or something like that,20
you keep it short and sweet because the shorter you keep it less is more especially in networking you want,20
conversation take the flyer home see my picture and the rapport is kind of regained because they will they will,20
sp sp sp now the next thing you wanna do is actually personalize these total life changes business cards my,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp my picture they remember that conversation that can,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp they will they will remember me just from seeing my picture they remember that,20

sp sp these correspond to the amount of processing power that each in the network may or may not have,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp is what happens when we also have vertex capacities,20
that between each si and ti we want to send a flow that satisfies all of the edge capacities but,20
finally our goal is to find a way to simultaneously and process as much of the flow as possible meaning,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and we want to exceed any of these vertex processing constraints either,19
at the same time this flow can allocate one unit of processing to one of the that it goes through,20

animals detecting different human facial expressions something according to research other animals like dogs and distinguish between faces and expressions,20
by species some studies have shown emotions are perceived as more prominently expressed on the right side of a face,20
the photographs they were shown were of the same person and when the emotions of different people were similar and,20
the university of iowa found that pigeons can see similarities among human faces when it comes to identity and emotion,20
at university found dogs could learn to pick out photographs of smiling human faces from those with blank expressions and,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and the research on dogs is particularly robust,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp in response to my criticisms of his view adopts a very interesting strategy,20
who believes in the objectivity of moral values and duties and who grounds them in a sort of moral in,20
the objection you just throw it back in the face of your opponent and say the same to you sp,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp philosophers call this strategy tu which is latin for the same to you,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp me your view is just as bad as my view,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp you sp got the same problem as me your view,20
opponent can show that his view is not really analogous to your view then stuck with this unresolved problem,19
the risk of this kind of a strategy is that it really answer the problem with your view it,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp this is financial planner patrick munro talking about financial assets,20

a cop on the beat focused on making the markets for consumer financial products and services work for american families,20
critical consumer financial protection activities performed by seven different agencies will be consolidated into one agency closing gaps in oversight,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp thanks so much for your important question,20
and it gets to the heart of the financial crisis which was caused in part by massive consumer protection problems,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp overly complicated mortgages and other credit products were allowed to flourish,20
the time seven different federal agencies were responsible for consumer financial protection but consumer financial protection generally their top priority,20
avoided risky credit were harmed by it because home values went through the roof and then fell off a cliff,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp in other words there was no accountable cop walking the beat,20
sp sp sp sp sp and none of them had the full picture of what was happening across the markets,20
sp sp sp so it was a really fun campaign on which to work and continues to be extremely successful,20
sp it started in and i think the reason why it was so innovative was actually built on three pillars,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp yeah the campaign for real beauty was really breakthrough,20
sp sp sp so it was a really fun campaign on which to work and continues to be extremely successful,20
only the girls but the moms who realized that dove was helping the next generation be freed of beauty stereotypes,20

bear in mind mushrooms are dehydrated at two different temperatures to begin with go check out the website about mushrooms,20
sp sp sp sp the aim of the bags is to help any remaining moisture distribute evenly among the contents,20

in the circus they are chained down in boxcars for most hours of the day sometimes for days on end,20
mother pigs are forced to live in cages so small that they even turn around for their entire lives,19
for cows i thought that there could be nothing wrong with dairy i thought cows just produce milk a,19

that because of growth hormones and unnatural diets sp dairy cows produce ten times more milk than they would naturally,20

little by little changing the lighting moving things around to try to get a good looking shot and so,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp good we started to move around furniture to arrange it to get this shot,20
just as key to innovation as coming up with the next sort of amazing sort of you know technical implementation,20
sp sp sp sp sp for example if ready to learn more then continue on to the next session,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp you can really make a difference,20
a difference between assigning writing and teaching writing sp a difference between assigning or asking for revision and teaching revision,20
reflect more thoughtfully about their intentions with regard to revision and makes that thinking visible to a teacher for inspection,20

going to need to have kind of your outlet type of presence out there sp a beautiful match for that,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp my main piece of advice for them,19

other great features about this app is the ability to communicate with a student one in a safe way so,20
hope is that sp connect the words that sp practiced on sunday with their life on wednesday and beyond one,20
sp sp sp sp issues another great thing about remind is to be able to have group conversations so i,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp so i can add a group of people to a conversation we can all,20
sp sp sp sp the way to do it is to use every muscle on your body including your voice,20
sp out if judging yourself sp tired of you judging me and slam it out on the bed,18
your ball bat and you yell and you scream and you go and push yourself and take everything out if,20
sp sp sp bed tired of a certain belief angry it and smash it on the bed do,18
which is your microphones and speakers really need to be of a good high quality to get that pristine sound,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp or report says clearly that was fantastic but what next,20
sp sp sp sp now the best way to get rid of and and things like that sp several ways,20

that the energy from the sun so that life can inhabit almost every nook and cranny of the earth surface,20
sp sp sp sp sp multiple pieces are interacting with each other to become the blue planet that we know,20
there is life itself that profoundly changed the earth where bare rocks are now topped with soils forests and grasslands,20
sp sp sp sp there is the ocean who is an important regulator of climate and the cradle of life,20
tapping energy resources that took millions of years to build and in the process add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere,20
to answer is how much greenhouse gases we emit into the atmosphere is being soaked up by vegetation and soils,20
when we talk about how life changed the earth we will also address how humans have contributed to this change,20
i sp seen a personality test yet that can tell you whether you should hire or not hire a person,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp the first question is why do you want to evaluate personality,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and so there is two sides we,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and so really the question is then like what is personality,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp ideal and that it does make me feel a little old no glasses,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp worth i know that i chose the best possible frames i might,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp frames i might upgrade those at some point and i definitely,20
as you can see they have a tendency to reflect the lights i use to make my videos but overall,20
sp sp sp sp videos but overall yeah i like myself better with glasses than without them there is one,20
i feel like a lot more likely to take you seriously if you do have glasses than if you but,20
know this sounds kind of i feel like the glasses complete my face in this weird way like never really,20
like never really hated the way i look but never thought i was super good looking either and the glasses,20
glasses have definitely caused an improvement in my concept of my own self image whatever worth i know that i,20
sp sp you already and i wanted to remind you got these sweet new mystic t shirts you can get,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp right growing my beard back turns out,20
but yeah she said she likes the full beard better and i like it too so coming back also i,20
i had accidentally complimented the good looks of another woman instead of like my own facial hair but yeah she,20
sp sp sp sp sp glasses this is still a little weird not entirely used to it like i keep,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp coming back also i got glasses this,20
that i have a mild astigmatism which makes long distance vision a little bit blurry especially at night the optometrist,20
higher level of blur than i had previously experienced in my life which was like none so the day after,20
driving at night the headlights and tail lights of the other cars were getting a little bit blurry it anything,20
to adjust my glasses when they slide down my nose and every time like my god's sp adjusting my so,20
sp sp sp shock the way i feel exactly a mid life crisis but kind of akin to one but,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp glasses not probably never gonna get over that system shock the way i feel,20
sp sp sp time now the first day i got my glasses i was a little bit down always had,20
them on everything became so much clearer that i just wear them all the time now the first day i,20
glasses since before i was born so this is not some like huge surprise out of nowhere it was pretty,20
sp sp sp down always had perfect vision and so it felt in a sense like i was that but,20
gotten used to wearing them i found out that i actually really like how they look i mean for one,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp nowhere it was pretty much inevitable and after that,20
sp sp sp sp old people a lot of kids wear glasses from a very young age my son luke,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp old no glasses are not exclusive to old people a lot of kids,20
one of my old videos which i do every once in a while and see myself without the glasses not,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp glasses it happened because i got old which,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp probably but i born with eyes that needed glasses it,20
he will almost definitely need glasses growing up and finally of the age where he will probably not break them,20

connected very intimately to your individual liberty of conscience in choosing what to read what to think what to believe,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp i really have choice to go into that profession,20
simply are the physical social manifestations of the freedom of choice or freedom of conscience that we take so seriously,20
profession that i choose then it not make sense to say that i have the right to choose a profession,20
make transactions in the economic we are putting into physical reality in the social setting the choices that we make,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp so the reality is no distinction between civil liberties and economic liberties at all,20
simply are the physical social manifestations of the freedom of choice or freedom of conscience that we take so seriously,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp the truth is no real distinction between civil liberties and economic liberties,20
the same and a mistake to try to separate them out and defend one at the expense of the other,20

the ideas i publish are punishable by death then i really have a substantial right to publish whatever i want,20

i love being a dividend investor and i think dividend paying stocks and are an essential in every portfolio to,20
stock market and one of my strongest passive income streams that i have coming into my wealth portfolio i,19
sp company when you buy stock in a company essentially becoming a part owner of that company giving,18
dividend is you really just have to understand what it means to be a shareholder of a company when you,20
to some of the rights and privileges of being an owner in the business and that includes the profit so,20
sp sp sp sp sp company giving them your money in exchange for a piece of their company because,19
will receive your payout proportional to the number of shares you own on the dividend payout date this is what,20
dividends are usually a cash distribution paid quarterly or sometimes monthly to shareholders in a company you have,18
you need to do is own the stock and you need to take any action after that the money,19
is what makes dividend investing so attractive and so easy because it really is passive income all you need,19
the things that makes dividend investing so attractive is companies often raise their dividends every year typically by to this,20
to buy more shares in the same company buy shares in another company or to withdraw and spend it one,20
of about to but you can definitely get stocks that pay seven eight or even double digit dividend rates,19
sp sp to this means the longer you own a stock the more making on your original investment most,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp risk so high dividend payers are usually riskier stocks,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp rates important to remember when chasing these dividends that rate reflects risk,18
the main one of dividend investing being that the company could reduce or even eliminate its dividend entirely now this,20
risk stocks in your portfolio is a great way to diversify your investments and increase your overall passive income like,20
lengths to continue to pay that dividend pay it on time and increase it year over year if you guys,20
stop paying them so a company will only cut or eliminate its dividend is facing dire financial straits otherwise,19

sp sp so perfectly competitive firms have zero market power whereas monopolies have lots of market power a firm with,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp market power occurs when there is less competition so,20

sp sp sp power a firm with high market power also has a very high price inelastic demand curve for,20
sp sp compare that to a firm which is perfectly competitive there are so many substitutes all over the place,20
sp power so what does this mean well it refers to the degree of control over price is the firm,20
sp sp sp the combination of these three factors gives rise to varying degrees of market power so what does,20
sp sp sp sp if you are in a perfectly competitive market you are just a small firm you cannot,20
and if so how much would changing its price affect its profit sounds to you think of it this way,20
goods everyone else and there are so many of everyone else you get anything there are so many substitutes so,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp firm you cannot set your own price if you set,20
sp sp sp sp price either why would you want to you can earn it at the market price but,20
sp sp sp substitutes so you want to set your price the lower the market price either why would you,20
sp sp sp sp sp you so market power refers to the amount of power you have over prices market,20
own price unlike the perfectly competitive firm where you take the market price because that the market dictating you so,20

sp sp sp sp sp movie it might be one to wait though and not go to the movie uhh,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp then you know they probably would like this movie,20
they are hypocrites because they do not know jesus and they even practice the things written in their book,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp the bible tells us to repent to turn from sin and to stop sinning,20
sp sp they believe they can continue to sin and that they are of god's if they continue to sin,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp may the grace of jesus be with you,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp may the grace of jesus be with you,20
they have never heard from jesus and they will discourage you from hearing from jesus and they will despise prophecies,20

road due to debt and other financial problems one thing is for certain i am never going to file bankruptcy,20
always dreamed of a quant house with a white picket fence and pristine grass since i was a little kid's,20
possible once you file bankruptcy and one drink everyone knows that buying a home is impossible once you file bankruptcy,20
considered hazardous income ratio in and probably the most important factor that they consider is your debt to income ratio,20
a home after bankruptcy important to understand what banks consider when determining whether or not to loan you money,19
generally a lender wants you to make a mortgage payment no greater than thirty percent of your gross monthly income,20
other words how much outstanding debt you have relative to the income that you have to support those debt payments,20

respond to his name when called because he sp tune you out as part of a long list of demands,20
last video do not link the sp name to demands such as dennis go get your shoes dennis come here,20
standing a foot or two farther away and by delaying the touching of a shoulder by a second or two,20
name while standing behind him and then immediately touch a shoulder and hand him a chip or blow the bubbles,20
and the reinforcement can be systematically faded out and your client will become more successful with responding to his name,20
sp sp sp sp sp by using this procedure dennis will learn that when he his name good things happen,20

children with autism have difficulty responding to their name i thought i would address it in this sp video i,20

you can have to different suppliers and actually to employment so absolutely fundamental it helps the whole scottish food industry,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp assumed that our climate is stable,20
based on a crucial assumption that we think about very much but one that matters desperately to us now,19
sp sp sp the easiest way to eliminate that is to take out a loan using that car as collateral,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp well so got of equity got of exemption so got of non exempt equity,20
minus the owed leaving of equity and of automobile exemption so there is no non exempt equity in the car,20
deal with that and followup with that video to see how to deal with that of now non exempt money,20
sp sp sp sp so be sure and obtain professional help and guidance in applying these principles to your situation,20
time and no place where the old phrase the devil is in the details is more applicable than in bankruptcy,20
sp sp sp sp so be sure and obtain professional help and guidance in applying these principles to your situation,20
often deal with the situation where cars have more equity then is the exemption available to apply to the car,20
sp sp sp sp sp first of all sp just real quickly define what we mean by the word equity,20
amount of equity in the car is greater than the amount of exemption that we have to apply to it,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp going to talk about two which are probably the most common,20

about having your kids write an online review of a product that they often use or know a lot about,20
manner that will make sense to somebody's else sp trying to decide whether or not they should buy this product,20
is to sit down and think and write a review of the product that will be useful to other readers,20

sp sp sp sp but the people do it because they really want to make the world a better place,20
sp sp anyone who runs for state wide office is a person who really does see public service over self,20
sp that comes from a deep commitment of the democratic process and wanting to make the world a better place,20
think paint the established politician sp been there for years like a pat lahey as somehow or other not appropriate,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp they ended up giving me over wholesale for that diamond,20

i become one of their clients for selling sp sure i will become one of their clients for as well,20
and then i found out sp got a store next door that sells handbags and all kinds of other stuff,20
so i figured i might as well cash some money out of it rather than just letting it sit around,20
had a large diamond that i wanted to sell and it was from a relationship that sp no longer in,20
sp sp sp so we ended up making an appointment came down met a guy's named timothy who is a,20
recommend anybody that has anything they even just want looked at even if you really want to sell it,19
because there is no pressure at all at least take it in and let's them take a look at it,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp freedom opportunity an autonomy,19
just thought sp share with you the three major benefits that exist as a part of being in our industry,20
they want to work and they have the autonomy to choose who is that they want to work with so,20
sp you see people who join the industry as a financial professional have a tremendous opportunity to build a business,20

big revelation to me has been not getting organized not having a daily schedule because sp not a scheduled person,20

sp sp sp sp sp and as a creative free flowing person i like schedules i like to,18
long and it has been through kathi getting me organized with time management and a professional filing system so sp,20

sp so he starts watching out his window watching people for entertainment until he sees uhh something that basically uhh,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp his and tv as sort of a little bit of additional punishment so he,20
because he is under house arrest uhh if this plot sounds very familiar i think i saw this movie uhh,20
sp sp sp sp sp that basically uhh him he thinks his neighbor is actually a murderer but there is,20
sp sp sp sp sp a rear window and it starred jimmy stewart and he was confined to his house,20

us to transcend our natural constraints marx argued but the way labor is organized leads to massive inequalities thanks thought,20
sp sp sp sp constraints sp go to the thought bubble to explore this some more think about it like,20
was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints we entangled ourselves in new social constraints sp go,20
sp sp sp sp sp ten thousand years ago basically everybody spent all day trying to get food in this,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp some more think about it like this,20
in this primitive communism as marx called it people were strongly bound by natural constraints but socially very equal now,20
sp sp sp food in fact they spent a lot of their time making food for the nobility people were,20
sp sp sp come from but you also have the peasantry who still worked constantly making food in fact they,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp work harder not a natural constraint anymore a social one working together,18
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp maintenance so sp having a good time here on orbit,20
sp sp sp sp sp is great we do a lot of scientific work also a lot of maintenance so,20
sp sp sp sp if you go outside as well you need to have one of those a space suit,20
station frank de winne well actually the crew spends little time working outside the space station because very dangerous,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp space suit it takes a lot of work but,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and very difficult to maintain the space suit it takes,19
sp sp sp them so therefore we try to spend as least time as possible outside of the space station,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp but also very hard to work inside of them so,19
sp sp what i did with the and the experiments that we based outside of the japanese module we,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp this is why we use a lot of robotics tasks for example,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp floating in orbit is just nice,20
you feel in orbit after several months frank de winne well as you can see jerome sp feeling just great,20
sp sp sp sp sp months in the beginning kind of going like all over the place and now,19
sp sp sp sp sp you can very nicely stay always in equilibrium after a couple of months in the,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp so life is great here the,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp over the place and now it just seems so relaxing,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp is good the company is good i have a,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp here the food is good the company,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and also the work is great we do a lot,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp is good i have a fantastic crew and,20

sp sp sp sp sp this is financial adviser patrick munro talking about the benefits of a versus an ira,20
may be aware that the funding for public broadcasting is being considered for elimination by congress in next sp budget,20
sp sp true that federal support is only a part of the funding necessary for public broadcasting to operate,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp thank you for your efforts and consideration,20
urge you to contact your congressional representatives and make your opinions and wishes known regarding the funding of public broadcasting,20
you your family and your community uninterrupted and with the uncompromising expectation of quality and respect for the sp intellect,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp murder people and get away with it umm the main plot,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp movie called the international umm clive owens is in it,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp line hi everyone today sp doing my stutter review on this,20
it very much i watched it about a week ago in theaters and it was so boring supposed to,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp in it and to be honest with you i remember it very much,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and is looking,20
but half the time i know what was going on he basically is a detective or works for the,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp person and these people that are in charge of,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp looking for this person and,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp umm supposedly trying to kill people and murder people and,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp in charge of a bank that,20
about acknowledging that something could happen but if it the individual can move on and continue to hope another day,20
describe the various fish throughout the story as though he were expecting them but only acknowledging that it was possible,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp the boy clearly likes fishing so he wasting his time,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp here that the definition of hope is most strongly carved out,20
about acknowledging that something could happen but if it the individual can move on and continue to hope another day,20
sp sp sp even a local farmer asks the boy why fishing there since nothing comes out of the pool,20
story about a boy who is fishing in pool a small hole in the countryside that is polluted with trash,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp the boy continues to describe the different types of fish that might visit pool,20
be connected to the open sea through underground channels which opens the possibility that anything could be in the pool,20
draws my interest and attention is the idea of the power of the word and ultimately the power of hope,20
about acknowledging that something could happen but if it the individual can move on and continue to hope another day,20
story the boy uses quite a bit when describing the different types of fish that could be connected to pool,20
a they can now dig much deeper and look at it within a satellite view or a street level view,20
is to create more sophisticated shopping and search tools that allow them to really find what sp looking for quickly,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and just not something that we could do a couple years ago,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and just not something that we could do a couple years ago,19
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp bye everybody,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp then sp ask you the same question but phrased in a different way,20
these words so that when the interview asks you that be able to understand it and respond back accordingly,19
so sp obviously lots of words in the english language and they all have similar means like school college university,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp started question what are you going to study,20
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp so sp go ahead and get started question,20

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp please leave comments below,20
they will lend and some will use this information determine if they are going to lend to you at all,20
