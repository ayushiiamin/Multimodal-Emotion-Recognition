the european union that much outside of britain and i think it has got negligible impacts on the united states

sp sp from a political perspective sp got disarray in the conservative party in britain and in the labor party
to the united kingdom is far more damaging than sp going to actually happen for the rest of the world

that will want to follow sp lead because i think what britain is doing to itself will be pretty damaging

realized yes this is a big splash for britain but a small ripple for the rest of the world

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp line hi sp here to review the umm house
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp this guy's kid's he sp played by christopher sp
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp a old school umm about umm

sp sp sp sp basically a umm a nerdy kid's comes to comes to live in this in a rough
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp trying to learn the ropes
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and uhh sp
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp then he meets this guy's play and they become kid's and play and
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp ropes trying to be and uhh then he meets
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp a guidance counselor and your future starts today
sp sp sp sp we find that sp very similar patterns when we look at customer paths in other domains
than that if sp talking about birds and fish or cars driving around the basic movement patterns are surprisingly similar
basic patterns about how people move around are surprisingly similar whether sp pushing a cart or clicking on a mouse
way that they do those things and the way that they react to different kinds of stimuli is surprisingly similar
actually no real stutter explanation really but they think the trees are trying to poison them because it makes the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp got to get back on track we need another signs we need another
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp even worse people running away from
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp did a very poor job in this movie
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp yup for twenty four hours and it sp just running away
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp make a
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp to do was make a
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp there we counted on m
like oh the twist and then it came and like uhh but you know what that was mainly
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp that was mainly lady
sp sp sp lady in the water which was just an atrocity and the happening was even worse people
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sense was a beautiful
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp movie it was
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp was a beautiful film i love that film
sp in this movie but like i said maybe he meant it to be really campy and really silly and
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp emotion like sound like me sp sound like a
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp man sp like uhh and i like her too but she just did
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp no like come on

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp like gonna kill me in my sleep
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp me in my sleep and sp like what
sp sp have been but mark wahlberg just killed it he killed it it he was so unreal in this
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp i mean even in one part an old sp like gonna
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp happening umm this was one of the worst
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp line hey expo tv today sp reviewing the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp stutter seen a lot of really bad movies i walked out
sp sp sp sp one of the worst movies sp ever seen and not even a lie sp sp
sp out of this one if i sp been praying for m night to pull something at the very end
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp i walked out of a couple movies and i
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp mark wahlberg was terrible he will never get a job after this
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp mark
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp campy and like a two hour long twilight
sp sp sp hopefully because he was so bad in this movie and m night wanted this to be campy
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp are rooting for m night i
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp to the twilight zone this is a terrible movie umm i know people
were actually really good in twilight zone this is this is stutter that was a insult to the twilight zone
hour long twilight zone and with even worse actors than they had back in the day umm they were actually
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp much more it really could have been but mark
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and it sp even that gory it could have been so much more
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp know he sp made a movie since lady in the water
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp m night i know you
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp forbid that movie too sp just on stutter he hit
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp in the water god's forbid that
sp sp years old like this kid's he he stutter know what sp doing any more the sixth sense
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp he hit his peak at twenty three
sp sp sp sp sp makes the part of their brain some chemical part in their brain shut off umm
and then there came the village which was not great but it was still okay there was the twist there
good but even then go see it even see it as a satire not worth it
sp sp sp sp make a movie where he could just have people kill themselves in the most creative ways
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp night has got to
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp a terrible film terrible m night has
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp night really wanted to do was
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp creative ways possible because all this was and it sp
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp umm so they all kill themselves so i think what m night really
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp silly and
sp but even if the application sp written well having this web application firewall gives you another line of defense
to check all the different ways to validate data inside of your application but your web application firewall certainly can
up with a series of standards that people have to follow if you store credit card information on your servers
level to be able to validate input into those web fields becomes critically important especially when sensitive data is involved
the sequel database then they would also have access to potentially credit card numbers that might be in that database
see this used to make sure that when people are information into a web form that that information is correct
trying to determine based on that web conversation if the information within your packets within that conversation is legitimate
those are very bad things because often that does allow somebody's some very detailed access to some very sensitive data
can get a four pack of these for the same price you can get cheap razors for because you
sp sp sp sp sp the one thing you definitely want to do is leave this in your shower
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp give it a try
sp sp so definitely keep this dry in between uses and get a much longer life out of them
sp because especially in the summertime most of us are shaving more often than we might in the cold weather
sp sp sp sp but if looking for a great new razor to try i highly recommend gillette venus
sp sp sp sp and they come in a handy little package like this to keep everything from drying out
sp sp sp sp sp sp now what makes these so great is this stuff right here and right here

i have to say sp talking sp talking got a great joke for you need to telegraph it
sp sp because then that automatically makes me think i might not think again we jump back to spontaneity
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp never really been his strong suit but he usually casts
sp sp sp sp sp actors or at least gets the best out of the actors that he casts to
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp casts to make up for it uhh with
sp sp sp sp gibson paul giamatti uhh bryce dallas howard sp all decent actors in his movies i
the problem is also that the dialogue and the acting are atrocious uhh probably the best word i can
sub par movies compared to the three movies that he made originally but they were at least well made films
sp sp sp sp films uhh this sp surprised this movie actually got any kind of release any kind of
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp distribution the dialogue is horrible never
is notoriously stutter wooden i know if that hurt the film or not but he also did not get
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp get anything out of john or who
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp line hi today sp reviewing
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp line
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp happening is the latest movie from writer director m night who previously
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp movie the happening umm the happening is
sp sp sp sp sp sp signs and the not so good movies the village and lady in the umm
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp previously directed the good movies sixth sense and
sp sp a little bit umm the movie stars mark wahlberg as a science teacher and as his and also
unfortunately this one even fit into the not so good movies category sp get to that in a little
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp something happens at the beginning of the movie
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp john as his friend
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp killing
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and for some reason people start talking funny
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp about and
sp sp sp sp the cause of this is never fully explained umm there are theories that are thrown about
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp problem with this movie sp so much the plot
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp big theory is pretty silly
but unfortunately most of the time the actors actually find themselves walking or running rather away from the wind they
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp plot umm it was probably a good idea
if that sounds exciting to you then maybe you can go check this movie out but otherwise bother umm
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp wind they run away from the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp or who are usually pretty fine
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp john or who are
sp sp sp sp sp sp it feels like the words are being read off of a script as
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp what exactly happened here but the acting it
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp so i know what exactly
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp themselves so i
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp fine actors themselves
watch what exactly will the new bailout for the banks look like what exactly is this new lending fund mean
potentially that the government is now going to create its own lending facility to compete directly with the commercial banks
sp sp sp sp another thing that addressed in his discussion and has talked about before is the mortgage bailout
to be very interesting to watch how the details unfold on what exactly he means by this new lending fund
people who have bought homes that they could not afford they also are not going to benefit from the bailout
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp does this mean that we are going to potentially change our bankruptcy laws
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp music
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp music
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp until next time sp mike sp from the university of texas at austin
look at president speech last night he made it clear that really not the path he intends on taking
way to try to force more competition in the banking system to try to get those banks to start lending
that more money will make its way to households to buy automobiles to fund college education and also to entrepreneurs

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp the work has started
sp of course i asked for it because i think this first step is long overdue as do many members
sp line hello sp like to tell you about a movie that a friend took me to see and i
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp line hello sp
sp sp sp sp stutter general plot is kind of you know a horror flick uhh people traveling are
sp sp sp sp sp i really like that much the movie is called quarantine and the the stutter
know picked off one at a time now that plot may sound familiar i know sp seen it in a
sp sp sp trapped in a hotel been quarantined for an unknown reason and sp slowly getting you know
up some tension but they really do a job in this movie it star anybody that sp ever
sp sp sp sp sp it in a dozen other movies and frankly uhh none of them are that good
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp latinos love the digital space and even more so the mobile space

starting today and i really look forward to helping you out further in more of my videos so thanks for
sp sp sp that can be a real great way to personalize and also stand out from the crowd now
sp sp sp now the final thing you wanna do is gather as many business cards as possible i want
this is probably the most important thing you should do and then follow up with these people afterwards give them
to follow up and just to see if you are actually open to what doing business wise you know would
so my place to order business cards is vista print a very reliable company they failed me yet had tons
tips that will help you to get more contacts for your business and expose your business to more people so
a link in my video description if you actually got a link already of where to buy business cards now
sp sp sp sp sp me yet had tons of orders through them they have served me for years i
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp cards out go to networking functions
next thing we do is that we network locally in order to hand these business cards out go to networking
you have to travel a bit but definitely worth networking gong to these events at least once a month now
sp sp sp sp sp look locally and see if there is anything for local business owners there must be
sp sp sp they will find any living breathing soul and just tell them all about their business this is
in and other companies they will go into these networking events and they will just throw up information they will
sp sp sp sp sp sp get maybe you can say something like this get paid to help people lose
wanna make it interesting so instead of you saying am a distributor in what you wanna say is get maybe
that work then and you would say one we help customer lose x amount of weight in x amount of
and then people can ask you more and you just tell them but in snippets of information and they will
are really interested then you can have them take a look at your website or video or something like that
you keep it short and sweet because the shorter you keep it less is more especially in networking you want
conversation take the flyer home see my picture and the rapport is kind of regained because they will they will
sp sp sp now the next thing you wanna do is actually personalize these total life changes business cards my
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp my picture they remember that conversation that can
sp sp sp sp sp sp they will they will remember me just from seeing my picture they remember that

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp the us i wish i had known what culture shock looked like because
in theory that going to happen that you come from different contexts but you know how going to play out
close and so you have to navigate those spaces you feel a little bit isolated from people back home after
sp sp and you can learn about their preferences and really become very targeted in your marketing to those folks
sp sp sp sp sp but also a really good opportunity to collect a lot of data about them
sp sp sp sp sp but then also being able to close that transaction is going to be very important

sp sp sp sp sp sp this is a comedy rated r sp a lot of cursing and but
sp sp gonna end and i guess you could say that about a lot of movies in hollywood's at least
really forced like sp trying too hard and the not very the movie is pretty formulaic you know how the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp annoying sean william scott in every movie that

animals detecting different human facial expressions something according to research other animals like dogs and distinguish between faces and expressions
by species some studies have shown emotions are perceived as more prominently expressed on the right side of a face
the photographs they were shown were of the same person and when the emotions of different people were similar and
the university of iowa found that pigeons can see similarities among human faces when it comes to identity and emotion
at university found dogs could learn to pick out photographs of smiling human faces from those with blank expressions and
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and the research on dogs is particularly robust
sp sp sp sp sp and researchers from kyoto university showed that dogs can match their face to their voice

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp hi good that you can join me in my study
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp in response to my criticisms of his view adopts a very interesting strategy
who believes in the objectivity of moral values and duties and who grounds them in a sort of moral in
the objection you just throw it back in the face of your opponent and say the same to you sp
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp philosophers call this strategy tu which is latin for the same to you
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp me your view is just as bad as my view
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp you sp got the same problem as me your view
opponent can show that his view is not really analogous to your view then stuck with this unresolved problem
the risk of this kind of a strategy is that it really answer the problem with your view it

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp my brother hunter set up a mock government we elected
sp sp sp issac as president ended up vetoing it and then we had a supermajority and we overrode him
we were learning a ton the kids were loving it and ultimately it ended up in a supreme court battle
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp it was just a lot of fun we were learning
a longer version so you can go check that out if you want to but sp the supreme court battle

sp sp sp sp sp sp increase accountability and effectiveness by consolidating consumer financial protections that are scattered across government
a cop on the beat focused on making the markets for consumer financial products and services work for american families
critical consumer financial protection activities performed by seven different agencies will be consolidated into one agency closing gaps in oversight
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp thanks so much for your important question
and it gets to the heart of the financial crisis which was caused in part by massive consumer protection problems
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp overly complicated mortgages and other credit products were allowed to flourish
the time seven different federal agencies were responsible for consumer financial protection but consumer financial protection generally their top priority
avoided risky credit were harmed by it because home values went through the roof and then fell off a cliff
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp in other words there was no accountable cop walking the beat
sp sp sp sp sp and none of them had the full picture of what was happening across the markets
sp sp sp so it was a really fun campaign on which to work and continues to be extremely successful
sp it started in and i think the reason why it was so innovative was actually built on three pillars
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp yeah the campaign for real beauty was really breakthrough
sp sp sp so it was a really fun campaign on which to work and continues to be extremely successful
only the girls but the moms who realized that dove was helping the next generation be freed of beauty stereotypes

bear in mind mushrooms are dehydrated at two different temperatures to begin with go check out the website about mushrooms
sp sp sp sp the aim of the bags is to help any remaining moisture distribute evenly among the contents
sp sp sp this cruelty caused me to have second thoughts about all animals and how we humans treat them
in the circus they are chained down in boxcars for most hours of the day sometimes for days on end
mother pigs are forced to live in cages so small that they even turn around for their entire lives
for cows i thought that there could be nothing wrong with dairy i thought cows just produce milk a
to be fattened up for slaughter and the mother pigs are forced to go through this process again and again
that because of growth hormones and unnatural diets sp dairy cows produce ten times more milk than they would naturally
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp produce milk a natural process so how could that be cruel
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp integrating life

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp pretty much more just rampaging
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp like personally you know another one of these blockbusters from
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp exist but the one that looms largest is russia
sp sp on trump but we need unverified reports to know that the relationship between the two is odd trump
sp sp sp a leaked intelligence report indicates that and the russian government may have compromising material on trump but
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sorts do you want to be complimented by that former officer because
sp sp sp sp sp is odd trump and launching a mutual admiration society of sorts do you want to

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp uhh not what it should be called it should be called
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp called curse of the dragon's
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp been sort of been downhill with this one probably being the worst this
sp sp sp sp sp that it was actually a fairly good and from that point on sp all been
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp this the first one was alright i will admit
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp called it should be called why do you keep making this
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp add anything new to it for me at a previous incarnations besides
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp ones so the story itself is not done very well it they
sp sp sp sp sp gonna go down as one of the dumbest movies ever so basic premise in the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp is probably
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp in a sort of suspended animation
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp distant past a few thousand years chinese emperor was
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and the guy's from the

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp junky but
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp it together to be something umm
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp of the previous ones
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp a vague rehashing of the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp just a vague
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp not that great cause really even in the end
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp that is not
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp really all that
i feel way more confident around men now and i am way more healthier than i have ever been before
many different diet plans that all turned out to be bogus i was so frustrated that i was still overweight
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and i had great results and sp really sure you will too
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp my weight problem was starting to really effective my life
called raspberry max actually helped her to lose weight so i decided that i wanted to give it a shot
about how raspberry are supposed to help you lose weight and i sp really sure if it would really work

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp of or other series of the summer and
sp sp line hello umm sarah here talking about spider man three one of the first of several extensions of
sp of the end of original entertainment and umm i think this movie was a perfect representation of that it
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and umm basically the beginning of the end of
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp the story was all over
the minimum that you expect from an action the fight scenes were weak characters were completely underdeveloped basically the story
on at all and it just like they put almost no effort into making it because they that because it

states like california which is a community state and in a number of other states nevada they are community states
style that sp going to need if you have an irrevocable trust a third party not a marital asset
practical purposes marital assets in divorce situation is hard but an irrevocable trust may be of significant help to read

managing director for estate street partners and the subject is divorce asset protection how to protect the assets in divorce
you are going to try to protect assets in divorce it really has to start with your parents if

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp that in divorce is the subject matter
irrevocable trust with an independent trustee that is a third party asset not subject to equitable distribution between the parties
that is third party irrevocable trust assets are not subject to equitable distribution in a divorce situation between divorcing parties
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sometimes what we think we see is not actually what occurred
some way try to figure out what sp saying and try to put it in context of what actually occurred
may feel is absolutely accurate you should always find ways to get a second party to verify what sp doing
sp sp sp a useful non digital source of information is witnesses finding people who have seen something going on
some way try to figure out what sp saying and try to put it in context of what actually occurred
to them call them write down what sp seen gather information about what they happen to have identified that day

be blind after a few years because the visual circuits need light waves for their development they just otherwise

there is life itself that profoundly changed the earth where bare rocks are now topped with soils forests and grasslands
sp sp sp sp there is the ocean who is an important regulator of climate and the cradle of life
tapping energy resources that took millions of years to build and in the process add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere

when we talk about how life changed the earth we will also address how humans have contributed to this change
i sp seen a personality test yet that can tell you whether you should hire or not hire a person

those that currently own stock may see this as a benefit because they are getting a return on their investment
to pay out dividends as incentives but again reinvesting it in the business is usually the path that is chosen
because they are usually in advance or they are and have to hang on to stock longer than normal stockholders

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp basic storyline of this movie
and minnie driver's are the two that i recognized and that i have seen in other umm the basic storyline
has kind of fallen apart his marriage his finances his relationships everything is kind of going downhill and the idea
sp sp sp sp sp sp is that there is a hollywood's uhh director and his life has kind of
sp sp sp sp lead to new things so just like if you throw a rock in a in a
sp sp sp idea is that these changes kind of ripple out and affect all aspects of his life and
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp when his personal life kind of falls apart it ripples out and affects
kind of go out and they alter and affect all the water around in the same same stutter uhh stance
sp guy's does not let's that ruin him or bring him down it actually leads to a sort of awakening
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp this sp professional life as well umm fortunately though this guy's does
and to make his life better and to try to take take stutter things into his own hands and do
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp awakening or
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp right

sp sp sp sp sp right all the now i know if this movie is uhh very well done
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp thinking that it was going to be a good movie

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp of depressing in parts and it just
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp was downer it was kind of depressing
sp to be a good movie umm but like i said everything put together here sp the soundtrack was downer
sp like it was pretty offensive the things like like stutter the fight scene like when umm it was really
bad stutter it was spent a whole bunch of money on it but it sp that some stutter like people
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp go to
sp sp sp sp sp sp offensive and it sp that and like they were they stutter like pretty they
the materials they use so like what the i the first twenty minutes when i watched it it was
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp but a little bit different by adding comedy it sp that
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp was kinda like three hundred

sp without them there is one other aspect of this whole thing though which is less than completely ideal and
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp ideal and that it does make me feel a little old no glasses
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp worth i know that i chose the best possible frames i might
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp frames i might upgrade those at some point and i definitely
as you can see they have a tendency to reflect the lights i use to make my videos but overall
sp sp sp sp videos but overall yeah i like myself better with glasses than without them there is one
i feel like a lot more likely to take you seriously if you do have glasses than if you but
know this sounds kind of i feel like the glasses complete my face in this weird way like never really
like never really hated the way i look but never thought i was super good looking either and the glasses
glasses have definitely caused an improvement in my concept of my own self image whatever worth i know that i
sp sp you already and i wanted to remind you got these sweet new mystic t shirts you can get
shirts you can get one by clicking on the little picture of them right down there thank you so much

move into my new bespectacled life as a middle aged man sort of okay with it and that is all
also made me realize that pretty okay with where i am at this point in my life i make a
and three wonderful children we got a real nice house in a real nice town in oregon sp probably gonna
sp sp sp sp sp back to my life i did get a haircut thanks for noticing no but clearly
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp hello rebel and welcome back to my life i did get
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp noticing no but clearly something is different on my face right
goatee better because i find it very and she kind of went silent for a really long time like so
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp right growing my beard back turns out
but yeah she said she likes the full beard better and i like it too so coming back also i
i had accidentally complimented the good looks of another woman instead of like my own facial hair but yeah she
sp sp sp sp sp glasses this is still a little weird not entirely used to it like i keep
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp coming back also i got glasses this
that i have a mild astigmatism which makes long distance vision a little bit blurry especially at night the optometrist
higher level of blur than i had previously experienced in my life which was like none so the day after
driving at night the headlights and tail lights of the other cars were getting a little bit blurry it anything
to adjust my glasses when they slide down my nose and every time like my god's sp adjusting my so
sp sp sp shock the way i feel exactly a mid life crisis but kind of akin to one but
sp sp sp sp sp sp glasses not probably never gonna get over that system shock the way i feel
sp sp sp time now the first day i got my glasses i was a little bit down always had
them on everything became so much clearer that i just wear them all the time now the first day i
glasses since before i was born so this is not some like huge surprise out of nowhere it was pretty
sp sp sp down always had perfect vision and so it felt in a sense like i was that but
gotten used to wearing them i found out that i actually really like how they look i mean for one
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp nowhere it was pretty much inevitable and after that
sp sp sp sp old people a lot of kids wear glasses from a very young age my son luke
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp old no glasses are not exclusive to old people a lot of kids
one of my old videos which i do every once in a while and see myself without the glasses not
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp glasses it happened because i got old which
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp probably but i born with eyes that needed glasses it
he will almost definitely need glasses growing up and finally of the age where he will probably not break them
really is helpful to them as opposed to advertising at them the way that we have seen in the past

are and how they work in the stock market and why they can do so much for you if you
i love being a dividend investor and i think dividend paying stocks and are an essential in every portfolio to
stock market and one of my strongest passive income streams that i have coming into my wealth portfolio i
sp company when you buy stock in a company essentially becoming a part owner of that company giving
dividend is you really just have to understand what it means to be a shareholder of a company when you
to some of the rights and privileges of being an owner in the business and that includes the profit so
sp sp sp sp sp company giving them your money in exchange for a piece of their company because
will receive your payout proportional to the number of shares you own on the dividend payout date this is what
dividends are usually a cash distribution paid quarterly or sometimes monthly to shareholders in a company you have
you need to do is own the stock and you need to take any action after that the money
is what makes dividend investing so attractive and so easy because it really is passive income all you need
the things that makes dividend investing so attractive is companies often raise their dividends every year typically by to this
to buy more shares in the same company buy shares in another company or to withdraw and spend it one
of about to but you can definitely get stocks that pay seven eight or even double digit dividend rates
sp sp to this means the longer you own a stock the more making on your original investment most
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp risk so high dividend payers are usually riskier stocks
sp sp sp sp sp sp rates important to remember when chasing these dividends that rate reflects risk
the main one of dividend investing being that the company could reduce or even eliminate its dividend entirely now this
risk stocks in your portfolio is a great way to diversify your investments and increase your overall passive income like
lengths to continue to pay that dividend pay it on time and increase it year over year if you guys
stop paying them so a company will only cut or eliminate its dividend is facing dire financial straits otherwise

sp sp so perfectly competitive firms have zero market power whereas monopolies have lots of market power a firm with
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp market power occurs when there is less competition so
sp curve for example in monopoly we have no choice but to buy things that monopoly there are no substitutes
sp sp sp power a firm with high market power also has a very high price inelastic demand curve for
sp sp compare that to a firm which is perfectly competitive there are so many substitutes all over the place
sp power so what does this mean well it refers to the degree of control over price is the firm
sp sp sp the combination of these three factors gives rise to varying degrees of market power so what does
sp sp sp sp if you are in a perfectly competitive market you are just a small firm you cannot
and if so how much would changing its price affect its profit sounds to you think of it this way
goods everyone else and there are so many of everyone else you get anything there are so many substitutes so
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp firm you cannot set your own price if you set
sp sp sp sp price either why would you want to you can earn it at the market price but
sp sp sp substitutes so you want to set your price the lower the market price either why would you
sp sp sp sp sp you so market power refers to the amount of power you have over prices market
own price unlike the perfectly competitive firm where you take the market price because that the market dictating you so

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp just recently released on and there
sp i would be able to name them for you basically based on the haunting of a high school
character for you that i knew in this movie some of the faces looked familiar but umm not so much
sp sp sp sp sp sp uhh sp haunted by her mother umm apparently her mother tries to uhh kill
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp high school student
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp haunts her in terms of psychologically
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp her when sp younger and it really
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp stutter teenage mutant
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp line i recently got to see the movie stutter
not necessarily by choice we happened to go to the drive in and it happened to be the second movie
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp turtles uhh
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp to say we stayed and watched the movie the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp with us that were little boys so needless to
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp wait til it was over but you know if you have little boys
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp little boys liked it the little girls fell i sp wait til
sp sp sp sp sp movie it might be one to wait though and not go to the movie uhh
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp then you know they probably would like this movie
they are hypocrites because they do not know jesus and they even practice the things written in their book
sp sp sp sp sp sp the bible tells us to repent to turn from sin and to stop sinning
sp sp they believe they can continue to sin and that they are of god's if they continue to sin
be discouraged by those people who do not know god's and point you to the bible but not to jesus
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp may the grace of jesus be with you
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp may the grace of jesus be with you
they have never heard from jesus and they will discourage you from hearing from jesus and they will despise prophecies
in a vision or a dream or if he speaks to you while you are praying probably a demon
anyone encourage them because everyone around them is on the devils team and discouraging anyone to actually hear from jesus
actually encourage you to hear the voice of the living god's to hear the holy spirit and to obey him
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp you know other christians may encourage you to go to church

thirty percent pain thirty percent payment will be willing to loan you the money after eighteen to twenty four months
to say about filing bankruptcy and maintaining the american dream of home ownership maintaining the american dream of home ownership
road due to debt and other financial problems one thing is for certain i am never going to file bankruptcy
always dreamed of a quant house with a white picket fence and pristine grass since i was a little kid's
possible once you file bankruptcy and one drink everyone knows that buying a home is impossible once you file bankruptcy
considered hazardous income ratio in and probably the most important factor that they consider is your debt to income ratio
a home after bankruptcy important to understand what banks consider when determining whether or not to loan you money
generally a lender wants you to make a mortgage payment no greater than thirty percent of your gross monthly income
other words how much outstanding debt you have relative to the income that you have to support those debt payments

first tell everyone in the environment to stop using or limit the use of the sp name throughout the day
sp sp sp sp sp sp the following is an excerpt from page of my book the verbal behavior approach
respond to his name when called because he sp tune you out as part of a long list of demands
last video do not link the sp name to demands such as dennis go get your shoes dennis come here
standing a foot or two farther away and by delaying the touching of a shoulder by a second or two
name while standing behind him and then immediately touch a shoulder and hand him a chip or blow the bubbles
and the reinforcement can be systematically faded out and your client will become more successful with responding to his name
sp sp sp sp sp by using this procedure dennis will learn that when he his name good things happen

autism and toddlers or the m chat and a diagnostic indicator on the autism diagnostic observation schedule known as the
sp a child not responding to his name once called can be one of the first hallmark signs of autism
children to respond to their names with dozens of children with autism and have found it to be very successful
children with autism have difficulty responding to their name i thought i would address it in this sp video i
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp since any behavior reinforced should maintain or increase
sp sp sp sp the key here is to pair the sp name with improving conditions which is called reinforcement
then took the opportunity to come back up to scotland because there many buying jobs in scotland three years ago

products to listing them on your shelves that affects jobs and communities it goes all the way down the chain
stores it could mean an extra five or six jobs at that particular supplier so always a good good moment
you can have to different suppliers and actually to employment so absolutely fundamental it helps the whole scottish food industry
our head office government bodies all sorts of suppliers and other people so being a key communicator is absolutely essential
spent doing the number crunching analysis a boring part but it needs to be done all part of the job

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp one version of an elevator pitch but there are definitely more the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp more the second lesson is to be visual more

her struggle with something that she used to do without even thinking about it sp have to leave the room
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp something about her was gone had died i guess you could say
sp sp sp when i realized that that something in her had died i finally gave myself permission to grieve
that to be an idea that the world that we live in today could certainly use a lot more of
sp sp more rock like structures than the ones that you used to get and add that to the mix

then i want you to ask one more question or answer one more question which is are these searches optimal

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp movie he plays a special forces soldier who has to
sp sp sp sp sp know jimmy stewart relies on the people around him and his girlfriend to kind of
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp bit cheated because uhh the plot is uhh very similar you know

sp so he starts watching out his window watching people for entertainment until he sees uhh something that basically uhh
sp sp sp sp sp sp his and tv as sort of a little bit of additional punishment so he
because he is under house arrest uhh if this plot sounds very familiar i think i saw this movie uhh
sp sp sp sp sp that basically uhh him he thinks his neighbor is actually a murderer but there is
sp sp sp sp sp a rear window and it starred jimmy stewart and he was confined to his house
sp sp sp uhh many years ago it actually came out about forty years and it was called a rear
better movie than the movie i have just seen in theaters uhh i kind of felt a little bit cheated

the umm i have been an avid fan of the simpsons most of my life and was quite that the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp line hey this is dan with a review of the simpsons
of a toxic waste dump and ready to be umm when things happen that makes it umm the national steps
an overblown episode per umm the simpsons the movie basically uhh it serves on the premise umm the entire umm
nothing than something you might expect from a halloween special to the shining or something like so there was nothing
too far fetched out of wacky simpsons and the uhh references within it uhh movies like and other references or
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp particularly funny particularly
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp too novel about it i find it
umm let's alone probably wanting to purchase this movie unless you get at a really good uhh it is a
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp particularly interesting
sp the parts where you actually get to see her and what sp going through umm with demons possessing her
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp is actually through flashbacks or through his storytelling umm the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp been like that this definitely sp been
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp are great umm if the whole movie sp been like that
sp sp sp sp one of my top movies of all time because the part where focusing on her
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp uhh starring laura linney uhh this
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp line hello today sp reviewing the of emily rose
not quite what i expected umm i expected something more along the lines of an the stutter exorcist umm where
sp sp sp is supposed to be based on a true story umm speaker narrator line the previews for it
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp the and going through it step by step like
sp sp where it actually shows the story of the girl and the priest coming in and and performing the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp who umm performed the on emily rose and speaker narrator line
just happen in this movie umm this is actually told uhh from the point of view of a priest
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp time you get to see emily rose is actually
sp sp sp it starts at his trial sp on trial for umm completing that and the only time you
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp if into this kind of stuff i
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp was very odd if
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp a big sort of uhh conspiracy to unleash a bunch of demons from
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp it was okay sp
sp sp sp sp sp sp stop this and rachel weiss plays a cop who sort of reluctantly agrees to
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp hell and umm keanu reeves is
she really believe him and he has an assistant who uhh the assistant has some pretty funny parts sp
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp agrees to help him basically
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp know this movie just do it for me i
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp not bad but i
sp sp sp sp sp starring keanu reeves and rachel umm in this movie keanu reeves plays a sort exorcist
sp sp sp sp sp sp line hi sp chris and this is a review of the of the movie
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp this is based on a series of uhh graphic
uhh in touch with the demon world umm his character is john constantine hence the title and this is based
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp stutter can see demons
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and he he stutter
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp them he has some fairly strange weapons that he
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp demons and he can see umm spirits and he basically fights them
those movies can tend to uhh run on the strange side uhh this sp a little stranger than it really
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp this that he uses to
courage to be honest about where sp at who am i and who am i becoming in the process and
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp hi so what is fearless financial mastery well really about leadership
years and helped lots of business owners make really great tax decisions about sp important about not paying taxes yet

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp because they just figured the way supposed to be
at the same point sp watching them struggle financially to fund their retirement plans to just make ends meet because

us to transcend our natural constraints marx argued but the way labor is organized leads to massive inequalities thanks thought
sp sp sp sp constraints sp go to the thought bubble to explore this some more think about it like
was that just as we freed ourselves from these natural constraints we entangled ourselves in new social constraints sp go
sp sp sp sp sp ten thousand years ago basically everybody spent all day trying to get food in this
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp some more think about it like this
in this primitive communism as marx called it people were strongly bound by natural constraints but socially very equal now
sp sp sp food in fact they spent a lot of their time making food for the nobility people were
sp sp sp come from but you also have the peasantry who still worked constantly making food in fact they
sp sp sp sp sp sp work harder not a natural constraint anymore a social one working together
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp maintenance so sp having a good time here on orbit
sp sp sp sp sp is great we do a lot of scientific work also a lot of maintenance so
sp sp sp sp if you go outside as well you need to have one of those a space suit
station frank de winne well actually the crew spends little time working outside the space station because very dangerous
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp space suit it takes a lot of work but
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and very difficult to maintain the space suit it takes
sp sp sp them so therefore we try to spend as least time as possible outside of the space station
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp but also very hard to work inside of them so
sp sp what i did with the and the experiments that we based outside of the japanese module we
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp this is why we use a lot of robotics tasks for example
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp floating in orbit is just nice
you feel in orbit after several months frank de winne well as you can see jerome sp feeling just great
sp sp sp sp sp months in the beginning kind of going like all over the place and now
sp sp sp sp sp you can very nicely stay always in equilibrium after a couple of months in the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp so life is great here the
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp over the place and now it just seems so relaxing
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp is good the company is good i have a
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp here the food is good the company
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and also the work is great we do a lot
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp is good i have a fantastic crew and
an easy task but then something good and sp sure all of us here in india are to go
sp sp sp so india can clearly be a superpower a question of how and when rather than if
an easy task but then something good and sp sure all of us here in india are to go
sp sp sp sp sp sp and very clearly we have many weaknesses as well which need to work out

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp well to answer that we have to do some statistical inference
sp sp sp sp sp sp or is this something just an artifact of our data just statistical noise
sp sp sp sp sp now in here in these brackets we see the number of observations in each group

we might be worried that this number here is just statistical noise and is not an actual effect so sp

church going to youth group and hearing about sp love and how there is a savior that you need sitting
going to throw a sump pump in that hole and then sp gonna get that water out of there this
i needed to rise out of that hole and accept sp free gift of salvation for my life so that

there was wow this is a community of people that love each other and care for for each other fast
my heart and softening it to finally three years later to finally decide hey sp go with you it really

being very good i am not exactly sure uhh what robert redford is doing in this umm i feel maybe
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp premise at the beginning but the uhh execution
this movie it turn out to be as good as it starts a fairly uhh promising premise at
sp sp was just poor and it make up mind if uhh a prison story or a

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp michelle is an extremely energetic dynamic speaker she gave
that you sat with me that i have sat with over people who have wanted to start their own businesses
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp because she had no idea i was writing a book i said
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp kind of she literally lost her breath for a moment i
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp and she just kind of she literally
sp sp sp moment and one of the things that you can give when you have nothing else is appreciation
sp sp breath for a moment i get a little choked up because it was a really special moment and
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp you can give credit and what i gave to amy so
sp sp sp sp sp sp always look for those opportunities but be okay that you do them yet
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp so be patient with yourself
sp sp sp but i did not the beginning of the movie starts out with this little dancing these little
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp to fall asleep but
sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp most hilarious part of the movie in
sp sp sp sp sp sp little dancing stutter food people and that part was probably the most hilarious part

sp sp sp sp sp all by the commitment of countries like the chinese to continue to buy foreign currency
as a result of the crisis in late we began to see a ripple effect a big day of reckoning
because the more goods they sold the more these western countries had to buy the currency of these emerging nations
and the early the emerging nations were doing extraordinarily well exporting a lot of goods to western countries like america
and to buy assets from the very countries who are buying their own goods in a kind of virtuous circle
sp sp and the more that currency was likely to rise which would mean those products would get too expense
sp sp sp sp so china started amassing hundreds of billions of dollars of american debt for example using dollars
indirectly other nations in the developed part of the world with a lot of money at very low interest rates
low interest rates we got a stimulus to the economies of the west in a way which is truly unsustainable
sp so they have to offer too much interest rates as governments to be able to sell that debt
so china lands up owning huge amounts of the assets of developed countries and then renting it back to them

sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp sp please leave comments below
they will lend and some will use this information determine if they are going to lend to you at all
lenders do not want to lend to borrowers that do not too much real estate and not enough liquid assets
is provided the lender will just adjust the total value of all your assets down to a more realistic figure
